Minikube and kubectl are tools used for managing Kubernetes clusters, which are groups of host machines that are used for deploying applications in containers.

**Minikube** is a tool that allows you to run Kubernetes locally. It creates a single-node Kubernetes cluster on your machine, which can be used for testing and development purposes. With Minikube, you can learn and experiment with Kubernetes without having to set up a full-scale environment [Source 2](https://kuberty.io/blog/minikube-vs-kubectl/), [Source 7](https://sysdig.com/learn-cloud-native/kubernetes-101/what-is-minikube/).

**kubectl** is a command-line tool for interacting with Kubernetes clusters. You can use kubectl to deploy applications, inspect and manage cluster resources, and view logs [Source 1](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/handbook/kubectl/), [Source 4](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/commands/kubectl/).

Here are some common kubectl commands:

- `kubectl get nodes`: This command shows the list of nodes in the cluster along with their status, roles, age, and Kubernetes version [Source 8](https://www.baeldung.com/ops/minikube-getting-started).
- `kubectl create deployment <name> --image=<image>`: This command creates a new deployment with the specified name and image [Source 12](https://www.howtogeek.com/devops/how-to-start-a-local-kubernetes-cluster-with-minikube/).
- `kubectl expose deployment <name> --type=LoadBalancer --port=<port>`: This command exposes the deployment as a service which can be accessed through a load balancer [Source 12](https://www.howtogeek.com/devops/how-to-start-a-local-kubernetes-cluster-with-minikube/).

For learning concepts like Load Balancing, Auto-Scaling, and Database Scaling, there are multiple online resources available. You can use cloud service providers like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud which provide hands-on labs and tutorials. Some of these services may cost money, but they also offer free tiers.

- **Load Balancing**: AWS provides Elastic Load Balancing which you can learn by following their step-by-step tutorial [Source 15](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/getting-started/). Another good resource is the book "Load Balancing in the Cloud" by Derek DeJonghe available on O'Reilly [Source 21](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/load-balancing-in/9781492038009/ch04.html).

- **Auto-Scaling**: AWS provides a tutorial on setting up a scaled and load-balanced application using Auto Scaling [Source 18](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/tutorial-ec2-auto-scaling-load-balancer.html). Another resource is the article "What Is Auto-scaling?" on the Datadog website [Source 16](https://www.datadoghq.com/knowledge-center/auto-scaling/), and Azure's best practices for auto-scaling [Source 19](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/best-practices/auto-scaling).

- **Database Scaling**: Oracle provides a guide on how to autoscale a load-balanced web application, including considerations for database scalability [Source 25](https://docs.oracle.com/en/solutions/autoscale-webapp/index.html).

Remember to check the pricing of these services before using them, as costs can vary based on usage.
