Both SOA (Service-Oriented Architecture) and microservices can be implemented using various technologies and frameworks. Here are some commonly used technologies and approaches for implementing each:

**SOA (Service-Oriented Architecture):**

1. **Web Services**:
   - **SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)**: A protocol for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services.
   - **WSDL (Web Services Description Language)**: An XML-based language for describing web services and their capabilities.

2. **RESTful Services**:
   - **REST (Representational State Transfer)**: An architectural style for designing networked applications using HTTP methods. RESTful services are typically simpler and use standard HTTP methods for communication.

3. **Message-Oriented Middleware**:
   - **JMS (Java Message Service)**: A Java API for sending and receiving messages between distributed systems.

4. **Enterprise Service Bus (ESB)**:
   - **Apache Camel**: An open-source integration framework that supports various data integration patterns.
   - **Mule ESB**: An integration platform that connects applications, data, and devices.

**Microservices:**

1. **Programming Languages and Frameworks**:
   - **Spring Boot**: A popular framework for building microservices in Java.
   - **Node.js**: A runtime environment that allows building scalable network applications using JavaScript.
   - **Python Flask**: A lightweight web framework for building microservices in Python.
   - **Go (Golang)**: A statically typed, compiled language that is well-suited for building microservices.

2. **Containerization and Orchestration**:
   - **Docker**: A platform for developing, shipping, and running applications inside containers.
   - **Kubernetes**: An open-source container orchestration platform for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

3. **API Gateways**:
   - **Netflix Zuul**: A gateway service that provides dynamic routing, monitoring, resiliency, and security.
   - **Kong**: An open-source API gateway and microservices management layer.

4. **Service Discovery**:
   - **Netflix Eureka**: A service registry for locating services in a microservices architecture.
   - **Consul**: A distributed service mesh to connect, secure, and configure services.

5. **Event-Driven Architecture**:
   - **Apache Kafka**: A distributed streaming platform for building real-time data pipelines and streaming applications.

6. **Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)**:
   - **Jenkins**: An open-source automation server for building, testing, and deploying code changes.

7. **Serverless Computing**:
   - **AWS Lambda**: A compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers.

Remember that the choice of technology depends on your project's requirements, team's expertise, and the specific characteristics of your application. It's also important to keep up with industry trends and best practices as technologies continue to evolve.
