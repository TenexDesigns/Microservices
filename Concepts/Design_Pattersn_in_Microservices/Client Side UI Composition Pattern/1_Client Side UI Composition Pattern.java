The client-side UI composition pattern is a design pattern that can be used to decouple the frontend application from the backend microservices architecture. It is a way to create a single frontend application that can interact with multiple microservices.

In a microservices architecture, each microservice is responsible for a specific task. This can lead to a lot of communication between the frontend application and the backend microservices. The client-side UI composition pattern can help to improve the performance and scalability of the frontend application by decoupling it from the backend microservices.

The client-side UI composition pattern can be implemented using a variety of techniques, such as:

* **Using a single frontend application that interacts with an API gateway:** The API gateway is responsible for routing requests from the frontend application to the appropriate microservices.
* **Using multiple frontend applications that each interact with a single microservice:** This approach can be used to improve the performance of the frontend application by reducing the number of requests that need to be made to the backend microservices.
* **Using a combination of single and multiple frontend applications:** This approach can be used to achieve a balance between performance and scalability.

The choice of which technique to use will depend on the specific requirements of the application.

In the case of your question, if the backend has different Spring Boot apps with different databases, then the frontend can have different React or Angular or Next.js apps to serve these different microservices. This is because each microservice will have its own data model and API, and the frontend app will need to be customized to interact with each microservice.

However, it is also possible to have a single frontend app that interacts with an API gateway. The API gateway will be responsible for routing requests from the frontend app to the appropriate microservices. This approach can be used to simplify the development and maintenance of the frontend app.

The best approach will depend on the specific requirements of the application.
