GraphQL and REST are both popular ways to build APIs. REST is a more traditional approach, while GraphQL is a newer approach.

**REST** stands for Representational State Transfer. It is an architectural style for designing APIs. REST APIs use HTTP verbs to define the actions that can be performed on resources. For example, the `GET` verb is used to retrieve a resource, the `POST` verb is used to create a resource, and the `PUT` verb is used to update a resource.

**GraphQL** is a query language for APIs. It allows clients to request specific data from an API, rather than having to request all of the data and then filter it themselves. This can make GraphQL APIs more efficient and easier to use.

Here are some of the pros and cons of REST:

**Pros:**

* Simple and easy to understand
* Well-established and widely adopted
* Can be used for a wide variety of applications

**Cons:**

* Can be inefficient for complex requests
* Can be difficult to implement correctly
* Can be difficult to scale

Here are some of the pros and cons of GraphQL:

**Pros:**

* Efficient for complex requests
* Easy to use for clients
* Can be used to build more complex APIs

**Cons:**

* Not as well-established as REST
* Can be more complex to implement
* Not as widely adopted as REST

The best way to choose between REST and GraphQL depends on the specific requirements of the application. If the application needs to be efficient for complex requests, then GraphQL may be a better choice. If the application needs to be simple and easy to understand, then REST may be a better choice.

Here are some scenarios where GraphQL might be a better choice than REST:

* When the application needs to be efficient for complex requests.
* When the application needs to be easy to use for clients.
* When the application needs to be able to build more complex APIs.

Here are some scenarios where REST might be a better choice than GraphQL:

* When the application needs to be simple and easy to understand.
* When the application needs to be well-established and widely adopted.
* When the application needs to be able to use existing REST APIs.

Overall, REST is a more mature technology than GraphQL, but GraphQL is gaining popularity due to its efficiency and ease of use. The best way to choose between REST and GraphQL is to consider the specific requirements of the application.

As for which one is mostly used, REST is still the most popular choice for building APIs. However, GraphQL is gaining popularity, and it is becoming a more viable option for some applications.
