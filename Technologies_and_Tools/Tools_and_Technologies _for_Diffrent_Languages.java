Microservices can be built using a variety of programming languages, frameworks, and technologies. The choice of language and technology often depends on factors such as the development team's expertise, project requirements, and the specific characteristics of each microservice. Here are some popular programming languages, frameworks, and technologies that you can use to build microservices:

**Java:**
- **Frameworks:** Spring Boot, Dropwizard
- **Technologies:** Netflix OSS (Eureka, Hystrix, Ribbon), Apache Kafka, Apache Camel

**Python:**
- **Frameworks:** Flask, FastAPI
- **Technologies:** RabbitMQ, Celery

**Node.js:**
- **Frameworks:** Express.js, Nest.js
- **Technologies:** GraphQL, Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ

**Go (Golang):**
- **Frameworks:** Go Kit, Gin
- **Technologies:** NATS, RabbitMQ, gRPC

**Ruby:**
- **Frameworks:** Ruby on Rails
- **Technologies:** Sidekiq, Apache Kafka

**Kotlin:**
- **Frameworks:** Spring Boot (Kotlin-based)
- **Technologies:** Kotlin Coroutines, Arrow

**Rust:**
- **Frameworks:** Actix, Rocket
- **Technologies:** Actix Web, Kafka-rust

**PHP:**
- **Frameworks:** Laravel, Laminas (formerly Zend Framework)
- **Technologies:** Laravel Horizon, RabbitMQ

**Language Agnostic:**
- **API Gateways:** Kong, Tyk, Ambassador
- **Containerization:** Docker
- **Orchestration:** Kubernetes, Docker Swarm
- **Service Discovery:** Consul, etcd
- **Message Brokers:** Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ, NATS
- **Database Technologies:** Various SQL and NoSQL databases

Microservices architecture is not inherently language-dependent; you can use a combination of different programming languages and technologies within a single microservices ecosystem. Each microservice can be implemented in the language that best suits its requirements. However, it's essential to consider interoperability, communication mechanisms, and overall system complexity when using multiple languages.

The choice of technology stack should align with your team's skill set and project goals. While microservices offer flexibility in terms of technology selection, it's also crucial to ensure consistency, maintainability, and seamless integration between different microservices.
