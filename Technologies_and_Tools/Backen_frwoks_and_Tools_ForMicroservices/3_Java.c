When building microservices with Java, you have several options for frameworks, libraries, and technologies. Here are some key points to consider:

1. **Java Microservices Frameworks**:
   - [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot): A popular framework for building microservices in Java. It provides a comprehensive set of features for developing and deploying microservices, including dependency injection, RESTful APIs, and service discovery.
   - [Dropwizard](https://www.dropwizard.io/): A lightweight framework that is designed for building high-performance, RESTful microservices. It includes features like built-in metrics, health checks, and configuration management.
   - [Micronaut](https://micronaut.io/): A modern, JVM-based framework that is optimized for building microservices. It offers fast startup times, low memory footprint, and support for cloud-native deployments.

2. **Java Microservices Libraries**:
   - [Netflix OSS](https://netflix.github.io/): A collection of open-source libraries developed by Netflix for building microservices. Some key libraries include Eureka for service discovery, Ribbon for client-side load balancing, and Hystrix for circuit breaker patterns.
   - [Axon Framework](https://axoniq.io/product-overview/axon-framework): A Java framework that provides the building blocks for creating scalable and event-driven microservices. It simplifies the implementation of Domain-Driven Design (DDD) concepts and event sourcing.

3. **Microservices Design Patterns**:
   - **Service Registry and Discovery**: Use a service registry (e.g., Eureka, Consul) for registering and discovering microservices dynamically.
   - **API Gateway**: Implement an API gateway to handle client requests, authentication, and routing to the appropriate microservices.
   - **Event-Driven Architecture**: Use an event-driven approach with message queues (e.g., Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ) to decouple microservices and enable asynchronous communication.
   - **Circuit Breaker**: Implement circuit breaker patterns (e.g., using Hystrix) to handle failures and prevent cascading failures in a distributed system.

4. **Technologies Depending on the Language or Framework**:
   - **Java**: When building microservices with Java, you can use frameworks like Spring Boot, Dropwizard, or Micronaut. You can also utilize libraries from Netflix OSS for service discovery, load balancing, and fault tolerance. Additionally, technologies like Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ, or Redis can be used for messaging and event-driven communication.

Remember that the choice of language, framework, and technologies depends on various factors such as the requirements of your project, the team's expertise, and the specific use case for your microservices architecture.
