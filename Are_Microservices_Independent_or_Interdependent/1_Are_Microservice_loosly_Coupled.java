Microservices are designed to be loosely coupled, meaning they are relatively independent and can operate without tightly depending on each other for proper operation. The goal of a microservices architecture is to break down a complex application into smaller, manageable components that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

Key characteristics of loose coupling in microservices:

1. **Independent Development and Deployment:** Microservices can be developed, tested, and deployed independently. Changes to one microservice should not require changes to other microservices.

2. **Separate Codebases:** Each microservice typically has its own codebase and repository, which promotes isolation and enables separate development teams to work on different services.

3. **Isolation of Failure:** If one microservice fails, it should not bring down the entire application. Services are isolated, reducing the impact of failures.

4. **Service Contracts:** Services communicate through well-defined APIs, often using lightweight protocols like HTTP or messaging systems. These contracts define the interactions between services.

5. **Technology Diversity:** Different microservices can use different technologies, languages, and frameworks, allowing teams to choose the best tools for specific tasks.

6. **Scaling Flexibility:** Microservices can be scaled independently based on their specific resource needs, improving overall system scalability.

7. **Autonomous Teams:** Microservices architecture often aligns with autonomous teams, where each team has ownership of specific microservices. This promotes faster decision-making and innovation.

However, while microservices are designed to be loosely coupled, they still interact with each other to provide a complete application. Some level of coordination and communication is necessary for the overall application to function correctly. For example, one microservice might call APIs provided by other microservices, exchange messages, or share data through databases.

Microservices architects need to carefully design how services interact, handle failures, ensure data consistency, and manage communication patterns. The challenge is to strike a balance between autonomy and collaboration, ensuring that while each microservice can operate independently, the entire system functions seamlessly as a whole.
