Yes, you can build a Maven project using IntelliJ IDEA. Here's how to do it:

1. **Open Your Project**: Open your Spring Boot project in IntelliJ IDEA by selecting "File" -> "Open..." and then navigating to your project's root directory.

2. **Configure Maven**: Ensure that IntelliJ IDEA recognizes your project as a Maven project. You should see a `pom.xml` file in the project's root directory. If not, you can right-click on the project root directory and select "Add Framework Support" to add Maven support.

3. **Build the Project**: Once your project is recognized as a Maven project, you can build it by following these steps:

   a. Open the "View" menu and select "Tool Windows" -> "Maven."

   b. In the Maven tool window, expand your project and find the "Lifecycle" section.

   c. Under "Lifecycle," you'll find the "package" goal. Double-click on it to run the Maven package phase, which will build your project and create the JAR file.

4. **View the Output**: After the build is complete, you can find the JAR file in the `target` directory of your project.

By following these steps, you can build your Spring Boot project using Maven within IntelliJ IDEA.
